# Page Templates

## How to Use Page Templates

Uno Toolkit provides handy templates that include all the proper layer structures to generate XAML and preview your designs through the Uno plugin.

### General guidelines:

- Page instances must always be detached from their *Main Components*;
- Components placed in pages must not be detached from their *Main Components*;
- The *Body* layer is where you apply background colors;
- The *Body* layer must contain all components you add to the page;
- Scrollable content must be housed within the `Content Scrollable` layer.

### Steps

1. Pick the template you need from the *Assets* section in Figma, drag it to the work canvas;
2. Select your desired variants from the Figma *Design* panel (on the right of your monitor);
3. Right click on it and select *Detach instance* from the contextual menu;
4. You may choose to rename it at this point;
5. To add components inside your page drag them from the *Assets* panel into the Auto layouts named *Section placeholder #*
6. Hide, or delete, the placeholder outlines and labels.
7. Delete unused placeholders
