# XAML Tab

## Using the XAML Tab

The XAML tab is another powerful tool to edit and troubleshoot the design. Useful to spot issues before handoff to developers.

It is possibled to edit the generated XAML to _try_ something else. By clicking the _Render_ button, the XAML won't be refreshed from the document, but only the preview will be updated from the changed XAML. Any new _Refresh_ will replace the XAML with a new one from the Figma document.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Proper XAML generation depends on usage of the proper templates and components, please read the [New design guidelines](../designers/starting-new-design.md) before starting a new project;
