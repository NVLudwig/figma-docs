# How to Use Uno Platform Toolkit and Plugin

## Links

The plugin is required to follow instructions in this section. Installation instructions are available in the [download page](../../download.md).

## Overview

Uno Figma Toolkit (UFT) and Uno Plugin allow to accelerate the designer to developer handoff by generating XAML code straight from the high fidelity designs.

UFT comes stocked with Components, Text and color styles that are automatically recognized by the plugin and converted directly to XAML. Designers can also get a live preview of the translated look, behavior and code from their work in just a few seconds.

The plugin functionalities have been organized into 6 main tabs: [Properties](properties-tab.md), [Preview](preview-tab.md), [XAML](xaml-tab.md), [Themes](themes-tab.md), [DataContext](datacontext-tab.md) and [Settings](settings-tab.md).

## General Plugin Guidelines

- Most of the features in the plugin requires that at least one layer in the document to be selected;
- To get the full power of the plugin, **it is highly recommended to start by duplicating the Uno Figma Toolkit**. Not doing so will prevent the plugin from recognizing its native components and styles;
- Depending on settings, it may be required to click the refresh button in the plugin to view results;
- *Properties* tab allows to impart behaviors and bindings to components;
- *Preview* tab allows the visualization of the generated XAML;
- *XAML* tab allows to inspect, edit, copy and export the generated code;
- *Themes* tab allows to inspect and copy to pasteboard the resource dictionary;
- *DataContext* tab allows to set mocked data for binding in the *Preview* tab;
- Properties, Themes, Data Context and Settings tabs all require saving changes before they can be applied.

> [!NOTE]
> The generation of the XAML and the preview of it is a resource expensive operation and can take some time to complete.

## About the Layout (Auto Layouts)

> [!TIP]
> It is possible to resize the plugin by dragging the lower right corner of its window. Simply hover the corner and drag it when the cursor changes for a double *resize* arrow.
